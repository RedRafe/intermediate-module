# INTERMEDIATE MODULES
Adds intermediate products to modules in order to productivity them.

---

### Main features

This mod adds three new intermediate products called Module Frames that are used to craft modules. Intermediate products can be targeted by productivity, so this mod eases your way to Tier 3 modules by introducing Module Frames of tier 1, 2 and 3. Each module frame is needed to craft the respective tiered module. Module frames are multi-purpose: a Module Frame of Tier 1 cost exactly the same of a normal module 1, but can be used to craft a Speed, Productivity or Efficiency module of tier 1. same applies for tier 2 and 3.

The cost and time of a T1, T2 or T3 module (vanilla) is maintained, but you can now apply productivity to the recipe of the intermediate to save materials then.
